# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added Javascript project I completed a couple of months back. I want to use that as a template and recreate it from scratch.

**Thoughts:** I struggled building that and needed a lot of help, but seeing the dropdown menu come together and function as it should was an amazing feeling. Very gratifying.
