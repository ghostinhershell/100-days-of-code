# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added Javascript project I completed a couple of months back. I want to use that as a template and recreate it from scratch.

**Thoughts:** I struggled building that and needed a lot of help, but seeing the dropdown menu come together and function as it should was an amazing feeling. Very gratifying.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
